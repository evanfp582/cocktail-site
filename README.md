## How to install dependencies
_Honestly I am a little iffy, but I think you just cd into client type `npm install` then cd into server and type 'npm install'_

## How to run
**Client**
  'cd .\client\'
  'npm run start'

**Server**
  `cd .\server\`
  `npm run start`

**Python DB UI**
  _This is best done in the CMD now in an IDE_
  `cd .\database_junk\`
  `python cocktail_add_gui.py`
